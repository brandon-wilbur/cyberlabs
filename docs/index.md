# Cyberlabs Project

Welcome to Cyberlabs - a set of cybersecurity training resources focusing on host-based and network security. This repository was first created as an aid for [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) students to help establish a common set of training materials that can be accessible to all competitors, regardless of direct mentorship received. These lab guides are intended to cover the fundamental parts of host-based and network security that students may encounter both in a competition and in a real-world environment. Content is aimed at novice security practitioners with additional advanced concepts presented in a digestible way.

## Lab Requirements

Lab environments are distributed as Virtual Machines in `OVA` files, PowerShell scripts, and Cisco Packet Tracer files. Windows labs will require an independent Windows virtual machine for executing provided scripts to create a vulnerable environment. Linux environments can be directly downloaded and run as an appliance in Virtualization software. Cisco Packet Tracer Labs require installing [Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) before getting started.

All lab guides are available online within this GitHub Page and are linked below. These are sourced via Markdown in the underlying repository.
